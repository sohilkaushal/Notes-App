# Notes-App

## Description

This is my project for unit SIT 313.

For the purpose of my first assignment I was required to explore the capabilities of Xamarin.Android and create a fully functioning application.

For the purpose of my assignment I have created a Notes Application that uses fragments to gracefully handle events.

The events that are currently implemented are as follows:

- User is able to create a note.
- User is able to view the notes and descriptions.
